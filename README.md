## Description
A quick and dirty MethodScript rewrite to patch a severely dysfunctional login-streak plugin. 

## Background
 - This is a low effort and hastily made MethodScript based replacement for a Login-Streak plugin.
 - It has customization capabilities, but they aren't well documented (again, low effort script).

# Depends on
- [Methodscript](https://builds.enginehub.org/job/commandhelper)


## Changelog
#### [Version 1.0]
  - Wrote and tested this script.
  - Released to github.
